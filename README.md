## Quick Start

- Download the latest [Pharo 32](https://get.pharo.org/) or [64 bits VM](https://get.pharo.org/64/).
- Download a ready to use image from the [release page](https://github.com/ba-st/Willow-Mixpanel/releases/latest)
- Explore the [documentation](docs/)

Include `WillowMixpanelMetadataLibrary` in the libraries updating the application root.

```smalltalk
(WillowMixpanelMetadataLibrary using: 'YOUR_MIXPANEL_TOKEN') updateRoot: aRoot
```
This will load the mixpanel support and then start tracking your events:

```smalltalk
  button onTrigger sendToMixpanel: [:mixpanel | mixpanel track: 'User event' ]
```
